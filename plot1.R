##1 plot1("name of file here") starts the function. For example: plot1("household_power_consumption.txt")
##2 the file is read into R and assigned to the power variable 
##3 the date column is reformatted as recommended in the assignment instructions
##4 the two days of interest are subsetted out of the power data frame and assigned to new data frame named "df"
##5 the Global_active_power col is reformatted as a numeric vector
##6 histogram is generated with the title "Global Active Power", red columns, and an x-axis label of "Global Active Power (kilowatts)"
##7 file is saved as "plot1.png"
##8 dev is closed
##9 statement is printed to let you know where the file has been successfully saved
