##1 plot2("name of file here") starts the function. For example: plot2("household_power_consumption.txt")
##2 the file is read into R and assigned to the power data frame 
##3 the date column is reformatted as recommended in the assignment instructions
##4 the two days of interest are subsetted out of the power data frame and assigned to new data frame named "df"
##5 the Global_active_power col is reformatted as a numeric vector
##6 a new column titled "timestamp" is added to df. This column consists of the date and time pasted together and reforamtted as a POSIXct class.
##7 plot is generated with timestamp on x-axis and global active power on y-axis. Default x-axis label is removed. Y-axis label is specified.
##8 png is generated as a 480 pixel by 480 pixel image. Its saved as "PLot2.png". Bitmap files default to pixels as their unit of measurement hence only using "480."
##9 statement is printed to let you know where the file has been successfully saved
