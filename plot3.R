##1 plot3("name of file here") starts the function. For example: plot2("household_power_consumption.txt")
##2 the file is read into R and assigned to the power data frame 
##3 the date column is reformatted as recommended in the assignment instructions
##4 the two days of interest are subsetted out of the power data frame and assigned to new data frame named "df"
##5 the Sub_metering cols are reformatted as numeric vectors
##6 a new column titled "timestamp" is added to df. This column consists of the date and time pasted together and reforamtted as a POSIXct class.
##7 plot is generated with timestamp on x-axis and sub metering levels on y-axis. Default x-axis label is removed. Y-axis label is specified. Legend is added with to the top right with line colors and variable names. 
##8 png is generated as a 480 pixel by 480 pixel image. Its saved as "plot3.png". Bitmap files default to pixels as their unit of measurement hence only using "480."
##9 statement is printed to let you know where the file has been successfully saved
